zGlossary-Fork
==============

This is an Fork of jQuery.zGlossary v1.0.2 which *uses span elements instead of a hrefs*. This change is due to not risk SEO mistakes using a lot of a hrefs to a glossary. Google seems not to like this in the past.

The Original zGlossary Plugin, you'll find at http://www.zazar.net/developers/jquery/zglossary/
