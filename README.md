zGlossary-Fork
==============

This is an Fork of jQuery.zGlossary which uses span elements instead of a hrefs. This change is due to not risk SEO mistakes using a lot of a hrefs to a glossary. Google seems not to like this in the past.

The Original zGlossary Plugin, you'll find at http://www.zazar.net/developers/jquery/zglossary/

This Version claims same Rights as the original Versions

You'll need additional files from the original Source http://www.zazar.net/developers/jquery/zglossary/
